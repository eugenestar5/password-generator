# Password-Generator

## Secured Password Generator Application

This web application is to help ensure users create a unique and secured password. 
It was created to demonstrate my JavaScript skills. A lot of JS skills was used in developing this web application,
which includes arrays, objects, if and while statements, functions, and returning values. Moreover, built-in methods 
like the Math.random and IsFinite was used and manipulating the DOM was also used. 



## Usage

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:


When the user clicks on the Generate Password button, there is a series of prompts and validations that allows the user to 
choose password length  between 8 and 128, upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. There is a validation 
on the password length that ensures users stay within the stipulated range. It is an optional for users on 
upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special character selections, however, there is a validation for users to select at 
least one of them. The application ensures that a secure password is generated any time the "Generate Password" button is clicked
and the prompts are responded per the validation requirements.

Below is a link to the deployed web application.
